## Fish & Shark Ecosystem
short description of your chosen predator-prey ecosystem 

## Roles
### Fish (Prey)
Every fish has their own amount of energy (between 0 to 19). Fish can eat algae in the environment to replenish their energy. When they move, it will cost them energy. A fish will die when it loses all its energy. Fish will also reproduce once they mate - this happens when they meet each other on the patch. The reproduction depends on the probability set by the user.

### Shark (Predator)
Every shark has their amount of energy (between 0 to 19) as well. Upon moving, sharks lose energy, and when all energy is lost, a shark dies. To regain energy, the shark will have to eat fishes. Similar to the role of the fish, sharks will be able to reproduce by mating and the reproduction process depends on the probability set by the user.
